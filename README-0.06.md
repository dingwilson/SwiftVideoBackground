## Requirements

- Swift 3+
- iOS 8+

## Integration

#### CocoaPods
You can use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) to install `SwiftVideoBackground` by adding it to your `Podfile`:

For Swift 3:
```ruby
	pod 'SwiftVideoBackground', '0.06'
```

#### Carthage
You can use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to install `SwiftVideoBackground` by adding it to your `Cartfile`:
```
github "dingwilson/SwiftVideoBackground"
```

#### Manually

To use this library in your project manually you may:  

1. for Projects, just drag BackgroundVideo.swift to the project tree
2. for Workspaces, include the whole SwiftVideoBackground.xcodeproj

## Usage

Import the framework into the ViewController
```swift
import SwiftVideoBackground
```

Link a UIView within a ViewController within the Storyboard to a BackgroundVideo item, or link it programmatically.
```swift
var backgroundVideo : BackgroundVideo!
```

Use the `createBackgroundVideo` function, with the name of the video or gif under `name`, and the file type under `type`. You can also include an alpha value between 0 and 1 under `alpha`, to adjust the brightness of the video.
```swift
backgroundVideo.createBackgroundVideo(name: "Background", type: "mp4")
```
```swift
backgroundVideo.createBackgroundVideo(name: "Background", type: "mp4", alpha: 0.5)
```

Note: Make sure you have added a video file to the project, and targeted the project. Also, make sure that you have set the module to `SwiftVideoBackground` for the BackgroundVideo UIView.
